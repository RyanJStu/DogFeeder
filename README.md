# DogFeeder
Using an Arduino Uno, Adafruit Motorshield V2, stepper motor, lcd/oled, DS1307 RTC,
and a generic cereal dispenser found on Amazon or at Walmart, the stepper
turns the spindle of the cereal dispenser at specific times each day
so that your pet gets a controlled amount of food every day. Status LEDs
are included so that you know if an auto-feed has happened. If for whatever reason
you feed the pet manually, i.e. if the auto-feeder is empty or got jammed,
a button toggles the LED status so you can keep track of your pets feeding schedule.
